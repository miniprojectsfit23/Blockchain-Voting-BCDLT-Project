# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
After project setup: npx hardhat init

Deploy Blockchain: npx hardhat node
Deploy Contract: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
